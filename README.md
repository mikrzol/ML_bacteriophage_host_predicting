# Prediction of bacteria-phage interactions with machine learning methods

This repository contains the code I wrote for my Bachelor's degree dissertation project.

The dissertation's title was: Application of machine learning methods for predicting bacteriophage-host interactions.


NB. this repo contains 'working code' - it may not be as clean as possible.
